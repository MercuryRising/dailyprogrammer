These are my attempts at reddit's daily programmer subreddit (http://reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer)

Currently the working problems are:
Stripping C comments (http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/wvg2r/7182012_challenge_79_difficult_remove_c_comments/)
A boolean algebra (http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/12k3xw/1132012_challenge_110_difficult_you_cant_handle/)
And star delete (http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/12qi5b/1162012_challenge_111_easy_star_delete/)

More coming soon!
